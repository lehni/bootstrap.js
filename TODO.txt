- Remove dependency on dontEnum and start moving to Object.defineProperty, also for getters / setters, where possible.

- Add support for hasOwnProperty wherever has is used (available in all modern browsers it seems).

- Use Object.keys in Object_each if available, as it only returns the keys in the object itself, not the parents. (only available in Chrome and Rhino right now)

+ Remove SET_ITERATOR

+ Remove Base.iterate:
  + Only support function iterators
  + Default for thisObject is global scope for all default JavaScript methods, except for each, which explicitly behaves differently than forEach
  + No need to override map / filter / any / some with slightly different functionality
  - Define collect in a way similar to these standard ones
  + Explicitly define Array#forEach if missing, and Array#each with added bind functionality as a link to it
  + Explicitly define Hash#each
  - and Hash#forEach in the same was as Array?
  + Define Base.each to use Array.each or Hash.each generics (or just (? Array : Hash).prototype.each for speed)

- Rename Hash#getKeys to #keys (and use Object.keys if available) ?
- Rename Hash#getValues to #values ?
- Rename Hash#getSize to #size ?
- Rename Function#getBody to #body, etc. ?
- Rename Array#getFirst() ? hmmm! tricky

x Remove support for beans and use explicit getter / setters instead? Ask Jonathan Puckey
